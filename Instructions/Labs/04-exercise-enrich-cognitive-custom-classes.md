# Enrich an AI search index with custom classes

You've built a search solution and now want to add Azure AI Services for language enrichments to your indexes.

In this exercise, you'll create an Azure AI Search solution and enrich an index with the results from a Language Studio custom text classification project. You'll create a function app to connect search and your classification model together.

> **Note**

                {"category": "Action", "confidenceScore": 0.99}, 
                {"category": "Comedy", "confidenceScore": 0.96}
            ]}}
        ]
    }
    ```

### Add a field to your search index

You need a place to store the enrichment returned by your new function app. Follow these steps to add a new compound field to store the text classification and confidence score.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the resource group that contains your search service, then select the cognitive search service you created, for example **acs18245-search-service**.
1. On the **Overview** pane, select **Indexes**.
1. Select **azurebob-index**.
1. Select **Edit JSON**.
1. Add the new fields to the index, paste the JSON below the content field.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "textclass",
      "type": "Collection(Edm.ComplexType)",
      "analyzer": null,
      "synonymMaps": [],
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "category",
          "type": "Edm.String",
          "facetable": true,
          "filterable": true,
          "key": false,
          "retrievable": true,
          "searchable": true,
          "sortable": false,
          "analyzer": "standard.lucene",
          "indexAnalyzer": null,
          "searchAnalyzer": null,
          "synonymMaps": [],
          "fields": []
        },
        {
          "name": "confidenceScore",
          "type": "Edm.Double",
          "facetable": true,
          "filterable": true,
          "retrievable": true,
          "sortable": false,
          "analyzer": null,
          "indexAnalyzer": null,
          "searchAnalyzer": null,
          "synonymMaps": [],
          "fields": []
        }
      ]
    },
    ```

    Your index should now look like this.

    ![A screenshot of the edited index JSON.](../media/04-media/edit-azure-blob-index-fields.png)
1. Select **Save**.

### Edit the custom skillset to call your function app

The cognitive search index needs a way to have these new fields populated. Edit the skillset you created earlier to call your function app.

1. At the top of the page, select the search service link, for example **acs18245-search-service | Indexes**.

1. On the **Overview** pane, select **Skillsets**.

    ![A screenshot showing selecting the custom skillset.](../media/04-media/select-custom-skillset.png)
1. Select **azureblob-skillset**.
1. Add the custom skillset definition below, by pasting it as the first skillset.

    ```json
    {
      "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Custom.WebApiSkill",
      "name": "Genre Classification",
      "description": "Identify the genre of your movie from its summary",
      "context": "/document",
      "uri": "URI",
      "httpMethod": "POST",
      "timeout": "PT30S",
      "batchSize": 1,
      "degreeOfParallelism": 1,
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "lang",
          "source": "/document/language"
        },
        {
          "name": "text",
          "source": "/document/content"
        }
      ],
      "outputs": [
        {
          "name": "text",
          "targetName": "class"
        }
      ],
      "httpHeaders": {}
    },
    ```

You need to change the `"uri": "URI"` to point to your function app.

1. In Visual Studio Code, select the **Azure** extension.

    ![A screenshot showing how to select the URL for a function app.](../media/04-media/copy-function-url.png)
1. Under **Functions**, right-click **customtextcla**, then select **Copy Function Url**.
1. On the Azure portal, replace the URI with the copied function URL. 
1. Select **Save**.

### Edit the field mappings in the indexer

You now have fields to store the enrichment, a skillset to call your function app, the last step is to tell the cognitive search where to put the enrichment.

1. At the top of the page, select the search service, for example, **acs18245-search-service | Skillsets** link.

    ![A screenshot showing selecting the search indexer.](../media/04-media/select-search-indexer.png)
1. On the **Overview** pane, select **Indexers**.
1. Select **azureblob-indexer**.
1. Select **Indexer Definition (JSON)**.
1. Add a new output field mapping, by pasting this field definition to the top of the output field section.

    ```json
    {
      "sourceFieldName": "/document/class",
      "targetFieldName": "textclass"
    },
    ```

    The indexer JSON definition should now look like this:

    ![A screenshot showing the edited JSON of an indexer with added output fields.](../media/04-media/add-output-fields-indexer.png)
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Reset**, then select **Yes**.
1. Select **Run**, then select **Yes**.

    Your Azure cognitive search service runs your updated indexer. The indexer uses the edited custom skillset. The skillset calls your function app with the document being indexed. The custom text classifier model uses the text in the document to try and identify the genre of the movie. The model returns a JSON document with genres and confidence levels. The indexer maps the JSON results to the fields in your index using the new output field mapping.

1. Select **Execution history**.
1. Check that the indexer has successfully run against the 210 documents.

    ![A screenshot showing the successful run of the indexer.](../media/04-media/check-indexer-results.png)
    You might need to select **Refresh** to update the status of the indexer.

## Test your enriched search index

1. At the top of the page, select the search service, for example **acs18245-search-service | Indexers**.

1. On the **Overview** pane, select **Indexes**.
1. Select **azurebob-index**.

    ![A screenshot showing an enriched search index.](../media/04-media/enriched-index.png)
1. Select **Search**.
1. Explore the search results.

Each document in the index should have a new `textclass` field that can be searched. It contains a category field with the movies genres. It can be more than one. It also shows how confident the custom text classification model is about the identified genre.

Now that you've completed the exercise, delete all the resources you no longer need.

### Delete exercise resources

1. In the Azure portal, go to the Home page, and select **Resource groups**.
1. Select the resource groups you don't need, then select **Delete resource group**.
